My project will probably not work with an external driver so I have supplied one (driver.cpp) that should do all of the tasks. (Some of the functions were created in different ways than they were assigned and now it is almost 6 so I donâ€™t have time to change them to match)  My driver does everything the test driver would have my program do, however.
